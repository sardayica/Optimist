            <p><strong>Medieval</strong>
                <br>
                <p>I love the flow and intensity of this song. It's creapy and synical from the name along, especially amongst the other seemingly normal song titles. The lyrics are about the ebs and flows of popularity as someone in the spotlight, especially highlighting the differnces between Finneas and Billy's fame.</p>
            </p>

            <p><strong>The 90s</strong>
                <br>
                <p>Once again I adore the flow and beats of this song. It's an upbeat, retro type of sound that's fun to listen too. I equally like the lyrics, which are about timess before the internet and being a kid who grew up in the transition into modern day media. Reminicing on how simple life used to be, and how much potential and hope Finneas had for his future.</p>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Happy Now?</strong>
                <br>
                <p>The lyrics of this song start off sardonic and pessimistic, talking about how Finneas seems to have everything so why isn't he happy yet? Then it switches the pace and beat to a upbeat song. The switch up is to lighten the mood and kind of make fun of himself for complaining so much when he really does have it pretty good with his fancy car and such. It brings light to the ups and downs of his life and being famous.</p>

            Sad song to get you in your feels. Love song, their voices really compliment each other. Intense moments, it's like taking you through a breakup that didn't really happen and missing the person.

                Finneas is dating Claudia Sulewski, and this song is about how much he adores her. Claudia is a youtuber who I've been watching for a number of years, knew her before Finneas, and it's just such a sweet song. She's even in the music video and the lyrics are just everything you want from a love song.
